/**
 * SurfaceType is used to describe the type of a given surface. The surface
 * types are also known as "backends" or "surface backends" within cairo.
 * <p>
 * The type of a surface is determined by the function used to create it, which
 * will generally be of the form of a {@code create() function}, (though see
 * {@link Surface#createSimilar(Surface, Content, int, int)} as well).
 * <p>
 * The surface type can be queried with {@link Surface#getType()}
 * <p>
 * The various {@link Surface} functions can be used with surfaces of any type,
 * but some backends also provide type-specific methods that are only available
 * on a surface of the appropriate class.
 * <p>
 * New entries may be added in future versions.
