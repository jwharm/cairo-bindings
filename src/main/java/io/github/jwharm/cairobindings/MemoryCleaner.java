/**
 * This class keeps a cache of all memory addresses for which a Proxy object

 * <p>
 * When a new Proxy object is created, the refererence count in the cache is increased.
 * When a Proxy object is garbage-collected, the reference count in the cache is decreased.
 * When the reference count is 0, the memory is released using the specified free-func.
 * <p>
 * When ownership of a memory address is passed to native code, the cleaner will not free
 * the memory. Ownership is enabled/disabled with {@link #takeOwnership(MemorySegment)} and
